    "\n",
    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages.  Because it is so popular a lot of the tasks you'll want to do already have code written and  ready for you to use (we call these collections of code, libraries). There are libraries for image analysis, building machine learning models, graphing, and scientific programming.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is considered one of the best languages to learn if you're totally new to programming. Its also used to do really advanced computing, python is used by Google, Netflix,Spotify, Instagram, Facebook. Its a highly popular language for scientific computing as well, the software written to get the first ever image of a black hole was written in Python! \n",

The jupyter notebook lets us combine code, regular text and output into one document. It's really useful if you're creating a document where you want other people to see the steps of a project you did and easily be able to understand/reproduce it. For that reason its often used in research projects. \n",
    "\n",
