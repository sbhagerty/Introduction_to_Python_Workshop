    "Python is considered one of the best languages to learn if you're totally new to programming. Its also used to do really advanced computing, companies that use python in production include Google, Netflix,Spotify, Instagram, Facebook.

It's really useful if you're creating a document where you want other people to see the steps of a project you did and easily be able to understand/reproduce it. For that reason its often used in research projects. \n",
